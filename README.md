- **Sound Effects:** Correct guesses, wrong guesses, and other game events are accompanied by sound effects.
- **Background Music:** Engaging background music plays throughout the game.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game updates the progress of the guessed word in real time.
- **Replay Option:** Players can choose to replay or exit after a game ends.
- **Word Pool:** Words are loaded dynamically from a file (`HangmanWords.txt`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pygame` library

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Solu-victoria/fun-hangman.git
cd fun-hangman
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install `pygame`, the library used for sound and music, via `pip`:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 3. Ensure Files Are Present
- **Word File:** Make sure `HangmanWords.txt` (containing the word list) is in the project directory.
- **Sound Files:** Ensure all sound files (e.g., `sounds/correct.mp3`, `sounds/wrong.mp3`) are in the `sounds/` folder.
- **Art File:** Ensure the `HangmanArt.py` file is present for displaying the Hangman stages.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Pygame Not Installed:**  
   If `pygame` is not found, ensure you've installed it using:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Sound Not Playing:**  
   - Check if the `sounds/` directory exists and contains the required sound files.
   - Ensure your computer's audio is enabled and volume is turned up.

3. **File Not Found Errors:**  
   Verify that `HangmanWords.txt` and `HangmanArt.py` are in the same directory as the main script.
